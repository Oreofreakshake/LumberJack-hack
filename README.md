**_To Run the Script_**
- Clone the repo 
- ```pip install pyautogui``` (if not installed)
- Run the ```player.py``` file
- Open the LumberJack game window

**_To Make it even better_**
- Inspect element of the LumberJack game window
- Go to source and you will see the JS file
- ```Ctrl + A``` the ```JS-script.txt``` file and copy paste it to the JS file
- Open the LumberJack game window (all the branches will spawn on the left side only)

_change_ ```pyautogui.PAUSE = 0.0``` to ```pyautogui.PAUSE = 0.1``` _if you only want to try python script only, else keep it as 0.0_
